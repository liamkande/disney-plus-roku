# Disney+ Roku Clone - Technical Assessment

This project was built with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Project Overview

A high-performance Disney+ clone built with TypeScript/React, demonstrating Roku development patterns and BrightScript architecture understanding.
Add this section after the "## Project Overview" section in your README:


## üéÆ How to Use the App

### Navigation Controls

The app is designed for TV-style navigation using your keyboard:

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| **‚Üë Arrow Up** | Navigate up between content rows |
| **‚Üì Arrow Down** | Navigate down between content rows |
| **‚Üê Arrow Left** | Navigate left between tiles in a row |
| **‚Üí Arrow Right** | Navigate right between tiles in a row |
| **Enter/Space** | Select the focused tile to view details |
| **Escape/Backspace** | Close the detail modal |

### Mouse Support
- **Click** on any tile to view its details
- **Scroll** vertically to navigate between rows
- **Scroll** horizontally within a row to see more content

### Features Guide

#### 1. **Browse Content**
- The home screen displays multiple rows of Disney+ content
- Each row represents a different collection (Featured, Marvel, Star Wars, etc.)
- Use arrow keys to navigate between tiles
- Focused tiles will scale up and show a white border

#### 2. **Lazy Loading**
- The first 3 rows load immediately
- Additional rows load automatically as you scroll down
- Look for "Scroll down to load content" message on unloaded rows
- This simulates Roku's performance optimization for large content libraries

#### 3. **View Details**
- Press Enter or click on any tile to open the detail modal
- The modal displays:
  - High-resolution hero image
  - Title and metadata (rating, year, genre)
  - Play and Add to List buttons (UI only)
- Press Escape or click the X to close

#### 4. **Visual Feedback**
- **Loading States**: Shimmer effects while content loads
- **Smooth Transitions**: All interactions have fluid animations

### Performance Features to Notice

1. **Caching**: Navigate away and back - content loads instantly from cache
2. **Image Optimization**: Images load progressively with appropriate resolutions
3. **Smooth Scrolling**: Hardware-accelerated animations for 60fps performance

## üéØ Key Features

### 1. **Performance Optimizations**
- **Lazy Loading**: Ref sets load only when scrolled into view
- **Image Caching**: Reduces redundant network requests
- **Smooth Scrolling**: Hardware-accelerated CSS transforms
- **Efficient Re-renders**: Optimized React component updates

### 2. **Roku/TV UX Patterns**
- **Focus-Based Navigation**: No mouse required, pure D-pad control
- **Visual Focus Indicators**: Clear white border + scale animation
- **Overscan Safe**: 90px margins respect TV safe zones
- **Hidden Scrollbars**: Clean TV interface without scroll indicators

### 3. **Production-Ready Code**
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety with detailed interfaces
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for API failures
- **Loading States**: Skeleton screens and shimmer effects

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Building and Running on Roku Devices

To deploy this application to a Roku device:

1. Run `npm run build` to create the optimized production build
2. Install the Roku Developer Tools on your computer
3. Enable Developer Mode on your Roku device
4. Package the build folder contents into a zip file
5. Upload the package to your Roku device using the Developer Application Installer
6. The application should launch automatically

Note: This project demonstrates React/TypeScript implementations of patterns that would typically be built in BrightScript and SceneGraph for actual Roku deployment.
